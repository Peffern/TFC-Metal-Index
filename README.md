TFC Metals Index
================

For TFC 0.79.29

This mod expands the TFC Metal system like the crops system so people don't have to worry about IDs or custom trapdoor rendering or anything - they can just pass a bunch of parameters in and create new metals.

Note: if you are using this mod in your environment, make sure to add com.peffern.metals.asm.CropsIndexLoading plugin to your list of Coremods so that my ASM gets executed
